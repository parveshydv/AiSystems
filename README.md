# AISystems
I have completed all the parts of the assignment

1. Created a swarm using separation, alignment, cohesion, wander, and obstacle rules.

2. Boids spawn at start and update with steering forces.

3. Added obstacle and boundary avoidance for the environment.

4. Used distance and dot product for neighbour detection.

5. Applied Symplectic Euler for movement updates.

6. Added path-following for boid zero using NavMesh.

7. SPACE key sends the target position to Swarm.

8. Boid zero moves through path corners while still flocking.

9. Assigned boid prefab, swarm object, and target in Inspector.

10. Tested the full system to confirm correct flocking and navigation.
